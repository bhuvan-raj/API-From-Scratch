Welcome to the API Fundamentals repository! This guide is designed to take you from knowing nothing about APIs to understanding how they work, why they're used, and how to interact with them effectively.

Each module builds upon the previous one, so it's recommended to follow them in order.


## Module Structure and contents


 [Module 1: Introduction to APIs](Module%201/README.md)

- Module 1 lays the conceptual foundation of what APIs are and why theyâ€™re essential in todayâ€™s digital world. It avoids programming jargon and focuses on real-world analogies and everyday examples to make the concept of APIs accessible to everyone.


 [Module 2: The Client-Server Model & Web Basics](Module%202/README.md)
 
- Module 2 introduces the core communication model behind APIs â€” the client-server architecture. You'll learn how clients (like browsers or apps) interact with servers by sending requests and receiving responses. It also covers essential web concepts like HTTP, URLs, and DNS, helping you understand how data flows across the internet. A hands-on browser-based activity is included to help visualize real API-like interactions.


 [Module 3: Anatomy of an API Request](Module%203/README.md)
 
- Module 3 breaks down the structure of an API request, explaining each component in detail â€” from HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, to URLs, endpoints, request headers, parameters, and body content. You'll understand how clients communicate with servers, how to format requests correctly, and what kind of information APIs expect and return. It's a crucial step before sending actual API calls using tools like Postman.


[Module 4: Understanding API Responses](Module%204/README.md)

- Module 4 explains how to understand and interpret API responses, including status codes, response formats like JSON, how to extract data from them, and the role of response headers.

[Module 5: Interacting with APIs (Tools & Practice)](Module%205/README.md)

To gain hands-on experience with APIs using real-world tools like Postman, Insomnia, and cURLâ€”focusing on how to read API documentation, make requests, and interpret responses.
