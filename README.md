Welcome to the API Fundamentals repository! This guide is designed to take you from knowing nothing about APIs to understanding how they work, why they're used, and how to interact with them effectively.

Each module builds upon the previous one, so it's recommended to follow them in order.


## Module Structure and contents


 [Module 1: Introduction to APIs](Module%201/README.md)

- Module 1 lays the conceptual foundation of what APIs are and why theyâ€™re essential in todayâ€™s digital world. It avoids programming jargon and focuses on real-world analogies and everyday examples to make the concept of APIs accessible to everyone.


 [Module 2: The Client-Server Model & Web Basics](Module%202/README.md)
 
- Module 2 introduces the core communication model behind APIs â€” the client-server architecture. You'll learn how clients (like browsers or apps) interact with servers by sending requests and receiving responses. It also covers essential web concepts like HTTP, URLs, and DNS, helping you understand how data flows across the internet. A hands-on browser-based activity is included to help visualize real API-like interactions.
