# Module 4: Understanding API Responses

## Goal

To interpret the feedback from an API, including status codes and data formats.

Once a client sends a request, the server processes it and sends back a response. This response is composed of several critical parts that tell the client what happened and provide any requested data.

---

## 4.1 HTTP Status Codes (The Server's Feedback)

HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by the server in the response header. They tell the client the outcome of its request. They are grouped into five classes:

### 1xx - Informational

The request was received and understood. (Less common in typical API interactions)

* **100 Continue**: The client should continue with its request.

### 2xx - Success

The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

* **200 OK**: The request has succeeded. This is the most common successful response.
* **201 Created**: The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result. Typically returned after a POST request.
* **204 No Content**: The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content. Often used for DELETE or PUT requests.

### 3xx - Redirection

Further action needs to be taken by the client to complete the request.

* **301 Moved Permanently**: The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
* **302 Found**: The resource is temporarily located under a different URI.

### 4xx - Client Error

The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled. The client is usually at fault.

* **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot process the request due to a client error.
* **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required and has failed or has not been provided.
* **403 Forbidden**: The client is authenticated but does not have permission to access the resource.
* **404 Not Found**: The server cannot find the requested resource.
* **405 Method Not Allowed**: The HTTP method used is not supported for the requested resource.
* **429 Too Many Requests**: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.

### 5xx - Server Error

The server failed to fulfill a valid request.

* **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error when an unexpected condition was encountered.
* **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unable to handle the request.

## 4.2 Data Formats in API Responses (Focus on JSON)

The data returned by an API in its response body is typically structured in a specific format. JSON is overwhelmingly the most common format.

### 4.2.1 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

**What it is:** A lightweight data-interchange format that is human-readable and machine-parsable.

**Key Characteristics:**

* **Key-Value Pairs:** Example: `"name": "Alice"`
* **Objects:** `{ "name": "Bob", "age": 30 }`
* **Arrays:** `[
  "apple",
  "banana",
  "cherry"
  ]`
* **Data Types:** Strings, numbers, booleans, null, objects, arrays.

**Why JSON is Popular:**

* Readable and concise
* Easy to parse
* Supported by most programming languages

**Example JSON Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "title": "Introduction to APIs",
  "author": {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com"
  },
  "tags": ["API", "Web", "Programming"],
  "published": true,
  "comments": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "user": "Alice",
      "text": "Great explanation!"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "user": "Bob",
      "text": "Very clear, thanks."
    }
  ],
  "relatedArticles": null
}
```

### 4.2.2 XML (Extensible Markup Language)

**Note:** Historically used in SOAP APIs. Uses tags and attributes like HTML. JSON is now more widely used.

## 4.3 Parsing JSON: Extracting Information

Once a JSON response is received, it must be parsed to be useful in a client application. Parsing means converting the JSON data into a format that the application can use, such as objects in JavaScript or dictionaries in Python.

Here are some examples of how to extract data from the sample JSON:

* **Title:**

  * JavaScript: `response.title`
  * Python: `response['title']`

* **Author's First Name:**

  * JavaScript: `response.author.firstName`
  * Python: `response['author']['firstName']`

* **First Tag from the Tags Array:**

  * JavaScript: `response.tags[0]`
  * Python: `response['tags'][0]`

* **Second Comment's Text:**

  * JavaScript: `response.comments[1].text`
  * Python: `response['comments'][1]['text']`

---

## 4.4 Response Headers

Response headers are pieces of additional information sent by the server along with the response body. They help the client understand how to interpret the response.

Common response headers include:

* **Content-Type:** Specifies the format of the response body. For APIs, this is often `application/json`.

* **Date:** Indicates when the response was generated by the server.

* **Server:** Provides details about the software used by the server (e.g., Apache, nginx).

* **Access-Control-Allow-Origin:** Used in CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to specify which client origins are permitted to access the resource. Important for web browsers making API requests across different domains.

* **Set-Cookie:** Sends a cookie from the server to be stored in the client's browser, often used for session management or personalization.

* **Cache-Control:** Defines caching policies. It tells the client whether it can store the response for reuse and for how long.

These headers are key to understanding how the server expects the client to handle the response, and they influence behavior like security, data handling, and performance.
